<p><strong>A six-member girl group from DSP Media. On August 24, 2015, she made her debut
through a showcase. The debut stage of the first music show was held at The Show
on August 25, 2015. The group name APRIL is a compound word of "A," which means the best,
and "Pril," which expresses a lovely woman, which means "female who has no choice but to love."
It also means that we will become a group that sings a warm feeling like in April. Since his debut,
the term "clean idol" has been coined.</strong></p>
